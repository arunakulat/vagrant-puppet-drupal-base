The version I used during my session at DrupalCamp London is in the [drupalcampldn](https://github.com/joesb/vagrant-puppet-drupal-base/tree/drupalcampldn) branch.

**If you use this project, please conside sponsoring my charity cycle ride London-to-Paris for Action Medical Research - http://www.action.org.uk/sponsor/jsbaker**

Action Medical Research is a great children's charity dedicated to improving the health of babies and children in the UK. Do take the time to find or more about the work of [Action Medical Research](http://www.action.org.uk/).
